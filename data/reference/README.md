This directory contains the human reference genome GRCh38.p14 published on NCBI by the Genome Reference Consortium in 2022.
We will map our deduplicated and trimmed reads to this genome to identify any host sequences within our files, which would
subsequently be removed.

Use the `obtain_reference.bash` file to gather the necessary files.
